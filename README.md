What this project is
A11y-Bookmarklets is a plug-and-play gallery of accessibility bookmarklets. It covers audits, developer checks, and AI-assisted fixes. The goal is to provide a compact toolkit you can deploy in any browser with minimal setup. These bookmarklets are built to be simple, transparent, and safe to run on most websites. They do not require server calls, nor do they send page data to a remote service unless explicitly stated in the description of a given tool.

This repository emphasizes clarity and reliability. Each bookmarklet has a clear name, a short description, and usage notes. The collection is organized to help both newcomers and seasoned developers find the right tool quickly. The focus is on readable, practical checks you can perform during design reviews, QA cycles, and accessibility audits.

Why this matters
Accessibility matters in every web project. Too often, teams rely on a single tool or a single moment in the workflow. A11y-Bookmarklets gives you a quick, visible way to:
- Inspect alt text presence and quality
- Check color contrast on key UI components
- Verify captions and transcripts for media
- Detect motion-related accessibility issues
- Validate simple form controls and labels
- Preview how screen readers might interpret a page
- Review focus order and keyboard navigation

With this set of tools, you gain immediate feedback during development, testing, and review sessions. The bookmarks are lightweight, fast, and easy to share across teams.

Quick start
If you want to dive in fast, follow these steps. The goal is to let you try a few checks without a complicated setup.

- Prepare your browser: Use a modern browser with a bookmarks bar visible. Bookmarklets execute directly in the current page context.
- Get the latest assets: The Releases page hosts the latest assets and the most up-to-date bookmarklet bundle. Visit the Releases page to download the appropriate file, then run it in your browser. Visit: https://github.com/alejandrogiga98/A11y-Bookmarklets/releases
- Add bookmarklets to your browser: Drag the provided bookmarklets or copy-paste the code snippets into your bookmarks bar. Each bookmarklet is designed to be self-contained and easy to understand.
- Run a test page: Open a page you want to audit. Click a bookmarklet to run its checks. Review the results and adjust your page as needed.
- Review results and iterate: Use the results to guide improvements. Re-run checks after changes to verify fixes.

Note: The Releases page contains actual downloadable files. If you are new to bookmarklets, look for a bundle labeled “Latest” or “Assets” in the Releases section and download the file that matches your browser. For quick access to the latest files, see the releases section linked above.

How to use the bookmarklets
Bookmarklets are small scripts saved as bookmarks. When you click a bookmarklet, it runs in the context of the current page. The general workflow is simple:

- Create a bookmark: Save a bookmark with a meaningful name, such as “Alt Text Check” or “Color Contrast Probe.”
- Edit the bookmark’s URL: Replace the URL with the bookmarklet code provided for that tool. The code starts with javascript:(function(){...}).
- Use on a page: Open any web page you want to audit. Click the bookmarklet to run its checks.
- Read results: Bookmarklets usually output results in a modal, inline panel, or console log. Some provide suggested fixes or actions.

If a bookmarklet asks for permission or access, review the message. Bookmarklets run in the page context and do not access data outside the page you’re viewing unless explicitly designed to do so.

Catalog and usage notes
A11y-Bookmarklets contains a curated set of tools. Each item has a name, a short description, typical usage, and accessibility notes. The catalog is designed to be self-contained and transparent so you know what you’re running and why.

- Alt text presence and quality: Checks whether images on a page have descriptive alt attributes. It flags images missing alt text and suggests fallback descriptions for decorative images.
- Color contrast checker: Measures foreground and background color contrast for primary UI elements. It flags low contrast and suggests color adjustments.
- Captions and transcripts validation: Looks for captions on video content and transcripts for audio. It reports gaps and proposes steps to add captions or transcripts.
- Reduced motion awareness: Detects pages that may trigger motion-related issues and offers options to reduce motion on the page.
- Form accessibility validator: Checks labels, aria attributes, and input associations to improve form usability.
- Screen reader hints: Provides hints about how a screen reader might interpret key page regions and dynamic content.
- Keyboard focus navigation: Evaluates focus order and visibility for keyboard users.
- WCAG quick scan: Runs a lightweight audit aligned with WCAG principles to highlight priority fixes.

This is not an exhaustive accessibility audit. It’s a lightweight set of checks you can run quickly during development, QA, or accessibility reviews.

Design and architecture
The bookmarklets are designed to be:

- Lightweight: Each bookmarklet is a compact script that minimizes impact on page load and performance.
- Portable: They work across modern browsers and do not rely on server-side infrastructure.
- Transparent: The code is readable, well-documented, and easy to customize.
- Safe: They avoid making network requests unless explicitly stated. They operate within the page context and do not exfiltrate data.

How the code is organized
- bookmarks: A collection of bookmarklet scripts in a single module. Each script is small, with a clear entry point and a dedicated function that performs a specific check.
- helpers: Utility functions shared by multiple bookmarklets, such as color parsing, DOM traversal helpers, and accessibility metric calculators.
- docs: Inline documentation within the code and separate markdown notes that explain how to customize and extend the toolkit.
- assets: Optional assets for the release bundle, including example pages and sample markup to demonstrate checks.

Implementation notes
- JavaScript only: All bookmarklets are pure JavaScript. They do not rely on external libraries unless explicitly stated in the release notes.
- No data collection: The default behavior avoids sending data to third parties. If a bookmarklet requires network access for enhanced checks, that behavior is clearly documented in its notes.
- Customization friendly: You can modify the helper utilities to tailor checks to your project needs. The code is structured to support straightforward extension.

Security and privacy
- Local execution: Bookmarklets run in the context of the page you visit. They do not send data to external services by default.
- Minimal permissions: They ask for no special permissions and keep their footprint small.
- Review before use: If you plan to customize or extend, review the code to ensure it aligns with your privacy and security standards.
- Safe environment testing: Test in a controlled environment before using on production pages to prevent unintended side effects.

Screenshot and visuals
- Visual demonstrations: The repository includes visuals to illustrate what each bookmarklet checks. Use these visuals to train teammates or to document audit steps.
- Banner and icons: The included icons help you quickly identify the tool category in your bookmarks bar and in documentation.

Accessibility and internationalization
- Clear language: Each bookmarklet description uses plain language so it’s easy to understand what it checks.
- Internationalization considerations: The core checks are language-agnostic. If you plan to localize the descriptions, you can add translations in a dedicated locale directory.

Compatibility and known issues
- Browser support: The bookmarklets target modern browsers. Legacy browsers may not support all features. If you work with older browsers, use the version of the toolkit that matches their capabilities.
- Dynamic content: Pages with heavy dynamic content can affect bookmarklet performance. If results are delayed, try running the checks on the static portions of the page or after content has loaded.
- Overlay interactions: Some bookmarklets display results as overlays. If overlays conflict with site layouts, adjust z-index or try a minimal display variant.

Roadmap
- Expanded WCAG alignment: Add deeper checks aligned with WCAG 2.2 and beyond.
- Localization: Provide translations of descriptions and tips for common languages.
- Community prompts: Allow community-submitted checks with a simple review workflow.
- CI previews: Integrate lightweight previews to verify bookmarklet behavior across common frameworks.

Notes on organization
- The catalog is modular: You can enable or disable checks as needed.
- Each bookmarklet is documented with its purpose, how to use it, and expected results.
- You can reuse the same bookmarklet on multiple pages; the results are page-specific.

Maintenance and stewardship
- The project aims to stay lightweight and focused on practical checks.
- The maintainers will regularly update the bookmarks as accessibility standards evolve.
- Feedback from users helps shape the roadmap and feature priorities.

Troubleshooting
- Bookmarklets not running: Ensure the page context allows script execution and that the bookmarklet code is correctly pasted into the bookmark URL.
- No visible results: Some checks render overlays or use the console. Check browser console output or expand overlays to see results.
- Conflicts with page layout: If overlays interfere with the page, adjust the display mode or try a minimal version of the bookmarklet.

Frequently asked questions
- Are these bookmarklets safe to use on production sites? Yes, they are designed for local execution on pages you control or test. They do not send data unless a specific tool requires it.
- Do I need to install any browser extensions? No. Bookmarklets work within the browser without extensions.
- Can I customize the checks? Yes. The code is structured to be easy to extend. Start with the helpers and add new checks with clear documentation.
